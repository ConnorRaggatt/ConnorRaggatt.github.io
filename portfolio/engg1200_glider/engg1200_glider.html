            <p class="paragraph">
                ENGG1200 saw students design and construct a glider that would be launched off a rail with the goal of maximising 
                flight time and distance. For this project, I worked mostly on the design of the glider itself while my teammates 
                took care of other areas of the project, like the flight time recorder, force gauges and paperwork. 
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                After first experimenting with wings cut from foam using a hot wire, I eventually settled on the idea of 3D printing 
                the wings and body of the glider. An early prototype of the glider used only a small tray attached the nose to hold 
                the flight data recorder. It was held on by clips such that when the glider impacted the ground, the module could 
                fall off and not absorb all the energy of the crash into the structure and risk breaking parts. This version was 
                extremely light and would have likely performed well, however, the tutors in the course decided that this was not 
                up to spec (despite nothing in the spec disallowing this approach). 
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                It was only at the last minute that we found out this design would not be allowed for the final project submission, 
                so I had to hastily rush to design a whole new fuselage overnight. As a result, the final fuselage used was large 
                and heavy, and to be quite honest, ugly. On the day, however, the glider performed well, and I was ultimately quite 
                happy with how the 3D printed parts performed. With more practice at designing gliders to be 3D printed and better 
                slicing software, I feel that 3D printed small scale planes could seriously compete with other construction techniques.
